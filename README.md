# AntColonyOptimization

The (artificial) ants in ACO implement a randomized construction heuristic which makes probabilistic decisions as a function of artificial pheromone trails and possibly available heuristic information based on the input data of the problem to be solved. As such, ACO can be interpreted as an extension of traditional construction heuristics which are readily available for many combinatorial optimization problems. Yet, an important difference with construction heuristics is the adaptation of the pheromone trails during algorithm execution to take into account the cumulated search experience.
